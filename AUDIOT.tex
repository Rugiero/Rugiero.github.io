  For example, a simple sine wave

      src="REF.wav">
      Your browser does not support the
      <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
  </figure>
  
<P>
  can after some multi-path propagation sound something like
  <figure>
    <audio
      controls
      src="EZ.wav">
      Your browser does not support the
      <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
  </figure>
<P>
  assuming that the receiver is moving at a constant speed, so that variation in multi-path sources Doppler shift will cause the aggregate signal to vary randomly in time.

<P>
  If we add some <A ID="tex2html15"
		    HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_noise">Gaussian white noise</A>

<P>
  we notice that the original signal is somehow recognizable from the noise (headphone users, watch out!)

  </figure>

  but the faded signal

    <audio
      controls
      src="EZ.wav">
      Your browser does not support the
      <code>audio</code> element.

will sometimes bury completely under the noise â€“ these events are referred to as <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">deep fades</SPAN>.
