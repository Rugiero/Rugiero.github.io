  <EM>For example, a simple sine wave

<P>
  <EM>can after some multi-path propagation sound something like
    <figure>
      <audio
        controls

        Your browser does not support the
        <code>audio</code> element.
      </audio>
    </figure>

<P>
  <EM>assuming that the receiver is moving at a constant speed, so that variation in the Doppler shifts in the signals propagating through different paths will cause the aggregate signal to vary randomly in time.

<P>
  <EM>If we add a Gaussian noise component we will notice that the original signal is somehow recognisable from the noise

        Your browser does not support the
        <code>audio</code> element.
      </audio>,
    </figure>

<P>
  <EM>but the faded signal
    <figure>
      <audio
        controls
        src="EZNOISE.wav">
        Your browser does not support the
        <code>audio</code> element.
      </audio>

<P>
<EM>will sometimes be buried completely under the noise â€“ these events are referred to as <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">deep fades</SPAN>.
